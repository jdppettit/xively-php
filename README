----

sendDatapoint(API_KEY,FEED_ID,DATA)

Description:
	Takes an API key, feed ID and JSON formatted data and sends a PUT request to Xively.

Arguments:
	API_KEY			Required, this is your Xively API Key
	FEED_ID			Required, this is the feed ID
	DATA			Required, JSON formatted data, see Xively API guide for more info

All arguments should be formatted as strings.

----

makeDatastream(API_KEY,FEED_ID,DATA)

This is the same exact function as above. The Xively API will automatically make a datastream
if it doesn't exist. Added for the sake of convenience. 


EXAMPLES
------------

Get a graph:
	
	$res = getGraph("apikey","feedid","helloworld");
	echo $res;

Would output:

	<img src="https://api.xively.com/v2/feeds/feedid/datastreams/datastream/helloworld.png?">

----

Send some data:

	sendDatapoint("apikey","feedid","somejson");

Would return:

	If successful: 1
	If failed: error message

----

Make a feed:

	Literally the same thing as above, except the JSON mentions a datastream that doesn't exist

----

JSON example:

{
  "datastreams": [
    {
      "current_value": "hullo, this is data",
      "id": "NameOfYourFeed"
    }
  ],
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
